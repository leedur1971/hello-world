Hello World!

Novice programmer here looking to make an impact on the world at large. Also, in addition to being a technical writer. likes to write fiction and make music via the piano and various other synthesizers.

Writing and music are my bags.

Coding is something that has interested me but never pursued it seriously. However, times change and my New Year's Resolution this year is to find a new job. Prior to being a Cardiac Technician, I worked in Quality Assurance for a medical publishing company. My roles in the company were diverse. I did everything from Customer/Cleint Service to Copy Editing to Technical Writing. 

My goal is to get back into Technical Writing. The research that I have done about getting back into the field leaves me with the impression that knowing at least one coding language would be beneficial. So, this is where my journey begins. 

It is my hope to leverage the experiences that I have gained through the years into a full-time Technical Writing gig.
